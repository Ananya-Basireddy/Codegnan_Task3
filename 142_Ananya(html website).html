      <p>Leonardo DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, USA. His full name is Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio. He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comic book artist, publisher, and distributor. His parents divorced when he was just a year old, and Leonardo was raised primarily by his mother.

        DiCaprio's mother, Irmelin, was born in Germany and later moved to the United States. His father, George, is of Italian and German descent. The name Leonardo was chosen by his mother because she felt her unborn baby kick for the first time while looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in a museum in Italy.
        
        Growing up, DiCaprio lived in various neighborhoods in Los Angeles, including Echo Park and Los Feliz. He attended Seeds Elementary School (now UCLA Lab School) and later John Marshall High School. He was interested in acting from a young age and began appearing in television commercials and educational films.</p>
